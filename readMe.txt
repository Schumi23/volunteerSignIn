The point of this program is to provide a simple sign in for SOPO Bike Co-op, a bicycle collective in Atlanta Georgia. We wanted something simple that runs on a Raspberry Pi, that simply requires someone to type in their name, and stores people entering when. The ability to add another field relatively simply (for example "Volunteer", "manager", etc.) is also wanted.
